# coolant-carriage
A computer numerical control (CNC) machine is used to cut and shape materials to form prototypes. A coolant is often used to act as a lubricant to aid a CNC machine to easily cut materials such as metals, fibreglass, high-density plastics, etc. It also helps to keep the workplace free of particles and debris coming from the workpiece the operator is cutting. The current CNC machine the our lab is using does not have a proper coolant system, a manual siphon system is used instead i.e. A tube immersed in a container of water is hand raised to different heights to allow the coolant to flow down to the coolant jet in the CNC machine at different pressures. Feedback from CNC machine operators indicates that the manual siphon system is both inefficient and tiring, disrupting workflow and causing user fatigue. In this project, a coolant carriage will be designed to hold the container and is free to slide smoothly vertically along an aluminium V profile.

### Bill of Materials (BOM)
List of components for the carriage to be 3D modelled with Fusion 360:
- V slot gantry plate to slide along the aluminium profile (Plate)
- Ratchet and pawl to move/stop carriage along the V profile (Ratchet) (Pawl)
- Carriage to hold the coolant bottle (Carriage)
- Bracket to hold the three aluminium profiles together (Bracket)
- Caps to protect against the sharp edges of the aluminium profiles (Caps)
- Bottle cap that is able to hold the siphon (Bottle cap)
